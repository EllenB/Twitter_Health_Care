Twitter_Health_Care
===================

This repository gives *some* of the code I have written for the optional project with Saama Technologies organised throught the Coursera course Introduction to Data Science.

The following files are added to this Github repository:

- **ANOVA_Analysis.R**: This file reads in processed tweets (with about 39 features) and does an ANOVA analysis on these tweets using day of the week, month and later on hour of the day.

- **HozBarPlot.R**: This code is for creating a horizontal bar plot showing the Top 20 authors of the tweet. The results is in a pdf file using a similar name.

- **WordCloud.R**: Code to create a word cloud based on a sample of the data (about 50 000 tweets). The output is given in a JPEG image.
